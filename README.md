# Bank Churn Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

## About the Project:

This project is a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze Bank Churn — the rate at which customers stop doing business with a bank. It is designed to help stakeholders quickly identify churn trends, customer behavior patterns, and key performance metrics that can support customer retention strategies.

## Objective:

The goal of this project is to:

•	Monitor the churn rate over time.

•	Compare active vs inactive customer trends.

•	Analyze customers by credit score, gender, and card status.

•	Provide valuable insights to help the bank reduce customer exits.


## Features and Tools Used:

•	Power BI Desktop for report creation and visualization.

•	Power Query for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation.

•	DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures and KPIs.

•	Interactive Charts (Bar, Line, Donut, KPIs)

•	Slicers for filtering data.

## Filters and Slicers
The dashboard includes interactive filters for:
•	Year

•	Location

•	Gender

•	Active Status

•	Credit Card Status

•	Exit Status

This allows stakeholders to slice the data across multiple dimensions and make granular observations.


## Key Insights from the Dashboard:

•	Total Customers: 10,000

•	Active vs Inactive Customers: A clear visual comparison of active (5,151) and inactive (4,849) customers.

•	Credit Card Distribution: Identifies that 70% of customers hold credit cards, while 30% do not.

•	Customer Retention: The dashboard shows that 7,963 customers were retained, while 2,037 exited.

•	Year-wise Trends (2016–2019): Bar charts display the yearly distribution of active vs non-active customers.

•	Monthly Exit Trends: A line chart visualizes the flow of customer churn month-over-month, helping pinpoint peak churn periods (e.g., September, November).
